PRESENTATION: TEAM MELANIE, KEVIN & DARKO

-went through the requirements, the instructions,...

-plan started with the structure of our HTML: we decided to make it as in wireframe and divide it to 3 parts 
 
  -decided to work and go with the flow and make decisions as we progress. aftre a few tries , we all decided to use BOOTSTRAP for the parts thus the whole Project!
		-we used SCSS as well-installed bootstrap through terminal and included JS for some parts!

  -we then made a forked project repo as our mutual Git repo with one working branch and feature branches with our names for pushing from local
			we all pushed and merged and then pulled the first version (the structure in html) as our 1. team GitHub colaboration!


-division of work
	-3 PARTS= 
			;Darko- Header & Footer ( added the back to top btn; JS ; where i found it...)
			;Kevin- First half of main -(About, Farm, Alpacas, Tours)
			;Melanie-Acomodation, farm Shop, Contact ( colors, design, linking the section to nav-bar, fonts)
		
		1. day-we had all our parts working separately-
		2. day-we merged the brancehs and solved conflicts-landing page was working!
			afterwords we tackled the design, colors, functioning of navigation and hero image...
				
		3. day merge problems-we learned a lot from our mistakes and how GitHub works and that was great challenge in this project
				we tackeld the finishing, the finess(margins, colors for the last time, text-decoration for links...
				
We met on friday (una hora because Melanie couldn't participate on Thursday after 14 h)to speak about what we did , what we could have done better, what we should do in the next Sprint/part
- and spoke about the presentation of the project on Monday! ;-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				
TALKING ABOUT PARTS INCLUDES :-WHAT EACH OF YOU LEARNED IN / FROM EXERCISE;
							 -WHAT WE COULD HAVE IMPROVED IN OUR PARTS 
		Kevin-talk about his part:
		
		Melanie about hers:
		
		Darko- his part: started with making own nav-bar than tried the bootstrap versions-found the one from our exercise (https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-landing-page-with-bootstrap-4--cms-32519)
						   we decided to implement this one
						used idea for a footer from a much bigger and complexer one 
						tackled the responsivness; the transparancy; deducting parts and figuring out how it works and why...started to include JS for it 
						  used fonts awesome for icons in the footer
						decided to add a back-to-top btn as a bonus feature: problems with code-with understanding Js behind it...
						   hero img-centering-positioning; text inside; Joke as a blockquote
						aligning the nav-bar titel ; links right/space between; bigger font, bold,change of text-color and bg-color...working with media queries	
						
						Better: navigation borders: hover off to close auto when mobile; icons hover, btn appears/ disappears and is fluid transition...
						
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------						
				WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED AS A TEAM AND WISH TO EMPHASIZE:
				-the commmunication is vital, making decisions, prioritizing
				-teamwork-important-showing the code
				-beeing flexible-to be able to adapt to a change, to accept a problem and try another way
				-making a buffer -for unexpected situations
				-comments were good; using Readme as help for commenting and following the adjustments;
				
				
		Melanie talks about what we could have improved in general:	
			-try to plan better and smaller tasks before merging*
		-design was not of great importance-it was introduced in requirements-to much time though
		-cleaning the code; 	 
		-bootstrap theming was a problem and we should improve;
		-bem, variables usage..
		-asking the client to aquire the content/text;	
			-COMMON MISTKES AND PROBLEMS:
				-directory paths(with or without a / or .. ;
				-bootstrap versions are the same -bootsrap installed"version. 4.6" implementing 5.0 stuff! errors appear :-D
